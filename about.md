title: About
---

I am a professional statistical consultant, working for a Go8 university in Australia. All observations are my own and do not reflect my employer, whoever they are. Before becoming a statistical consultant 6 years ago (as of May 2025), I was a medical researcher for 16 years. Initially I worked in a wet lab, but swiftly turned to bioinformatics and eventually retrained in statistics, completing a Master of Biostatistics. So all up that is over 20 years of problem solving experience the research-adjacent world.

The title "Rubber Duck Statistics" came to me on one of my many walks around my suburb. It is a reference to the concept of "Rubber Duck Debugging" that I first heard about from my software development colleagues.
